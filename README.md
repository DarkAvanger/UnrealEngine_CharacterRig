# Advanced Character Rigging in 3D  - Final Degree Project

This repository contains my final degree project: a body rig for Tom from the classic "Tom and Jerry" series. The project involves creating a detailed rig, generating poses and animations, and importing the rig into Unreal Engine for further testing and retargeting. Below is an overview of the project structure and content.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Tom Rig**: Contains the Maya rig file for Tom.

- **Tom Poses**: This folder includes a collection of poses for Tom. 

- **Tom Maya Animations**: Contains a series of animated sequences for Tom ready to use in Unreal Engine.

- **TomRetarget**: Includes the Unreal Engine project where the rigged model has been imported. In this project, I have retargeted animations from the default Unreal Engine mannequin to Tom, testing them within a sample scene to ensure proper integration and performance.

## Videos

Here are two videos related to the project:

1. **Rig Showcase**: A short video showing the various controls and features.
